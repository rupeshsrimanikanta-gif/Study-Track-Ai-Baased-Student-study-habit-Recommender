# Milestone 3: Study Track AI-Based Student Study Habit Recommender

## Objective
Show how clustering on student data is used to give personalized study recommendations.

## Dataset Source
- Kaggle "StudentsPerformance.csv" dataset, with clustering using KMeans on scores.

## Steps Followed
1. Assigned clusters (ClusterID) to students.
2. Mapped clusters to study recommendations.
3. Used Python to automate and add recommendations.
4. Added new columns: Recommendation, Tool/Technique.
5. Created a count plot showing recommendations distribution.

## Tools Used
- Google Colab, Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib), GitHub

## Key Insights
- Cluster 0: Needs time management
- Cluster 1: Maintain routine, focus weak areas
- Cluster 2: Improve attendance, engagement

## Visualization
Folder structure:
