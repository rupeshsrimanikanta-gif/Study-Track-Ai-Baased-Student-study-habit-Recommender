# Student Performance EDA Project

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes the Student Performance dataset. It covers data loading, cleaning, merging, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and pandas in Google Colab.

## Files Included
- `Milestone1_EDA.ipynb` &mdash; Main analysis notebook
- `students.csv` &mdash; Table with student details
- `scores.csv` &mdash; Table with scores for math, reading, and writing

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading**: Loaded students and scores data from CSV files.
2. **Merging**: Combined both tables using Student_ID.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, checked for missing values, and encoded categorical variables.
4. **Descriptive Statistics**: Described key statistics and relationships using pandas.
5. **EDA & Visualization**: Plotted distributions, boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.
6. **Observations**: Recorded main trends and insights from data.

## Key Observations
- Average scores for students who prepared for the test were higher.
- Reading and writing scores were strongly correlated.
- Some outliers in scores were detected.

## How to Run
1. Upload the CSV files and notebook to Google Colab.
2. Run the notebook cells in order (add your explanations as markdown).
